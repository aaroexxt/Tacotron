AS001-0001|Jane Eyre, an autobiography, by Charlotte Brontë|
AS001-0002|Preface. A preface to the first edition of "Jane Eyre"
AS001-0003|being unnecessary, I gave none:
AS001-0004|this second edition demands a few words both of acknowledgment and miscellaneous remark.
AS001-0005|My thanks are due in three quarters. To the public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain tale with few pretensions. To the press,
AS001-0006|for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened to an obscure aspirant.
AS001-0007|To my publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their practical sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and unrecommended author.
AS001-0008|The Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me,
AS001-0009|and I must thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: so are certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only large-hearted
AS001-0010|and high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling stranger; to them, that is. To my Publishers and the select Reviewers, I say cordially, gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.
AS001-0011|Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and approved me, I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know, but not, therefore, to be overlooked.
AS001-0012|I mean the timorous or carping few who doubt the tendency
AS001-0013|of such books as "Jane Eyre:" in whose eyes whatever is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest against bigotry—that parent of crime—an insult to piety, that regent of God on earth.
AS001-0014|I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions; I would remind them of certain simple truths.
AS001-0015|Conventionality is not morality.  Self-righteousness is not religion.  To attack the first is not to assail the last.  To pluck the mask from the face of the Pharisee,
AS001-0016|is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of Thorns. These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct as is vice from virtue.
AS001-0017|Men too often confound them: they should not be confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few,
AS001-0018|should not be substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ.  There is—I repeat it—a difference;
AS001-0019|The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has been accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make external show pass for sterling worth
AS001-0020|to let white-washed walls vouch for clean shrines.  It may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose
AS001-0021|to rase the gilding, and show base metal under it—to penetrate the sepulchre, and reveal charnel relics: but hate as it will, it is indebted to him.
AS001-0022|Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good concerning him, but evil; probably he liked the sycophant son of Chenaannah better;
AS001-0023|yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he but stopped his ears to flattery, and opened them to faithful counsel.
AS001-0024|There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle delicate ears:
AS001-0025|who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones of society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings of Judah and Israel;
AS001-0026|and who speaks truth as deep, with a power as prophet-like and as vital—a mien as dauntless and as daring.
AS001-0027|Is the satirist of “Vanity Fair” admired in high places?  I cannot tell; but I think if some of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire of his sarcasm,
AS001-0028|and over whom he flashes the levin-brand of his denunciation, were to take his warnings in time—they or their seed might yet escape a fatal Rimoth-Gilead.
AS001-0029|Why have I alluded to this man? I have alluded to him, reader, because I think I see in him an intellect profounder
AS001-0030|and more unique than his contemporaries have yet recognised; because I regard him as the first social regenerator of the day—as the very master of that working corps who would restore to
AS001-0031|rectitude the warped system of things; because I think no commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that suits him,
AS001-0032|the terms which rightly characterise his talent. They say he is like Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic powers.
AS001-0033|He resembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on carrion, but Thackeray never does.
AS001-0034|His wit is bright, his humour attractive, but both bear the same relation to his serious genius that the mere lambent sheer-lightning playing under the edge of the summer-cloud
AS001-0035|does to the electric death-spark hid in its womb.  Finally, I have alluded to Mr. Thackeray, because to him—if he will accept the tribute of a total stranger
AS001-0036|I have dedicated this second edition of "Jane Eyre."
AS001-0037|Note to the third edition. I avail myself of the opportunity which a third edition of "Jane Eyre" affords me, of again addressing a word to the public,
AS001-0038|to explain that my claim to the title of novelist rests on this one work alone.  If, therefore, the authorship of other works of fiction has been attributed to me,
AS001-0039|an honour is awarded where it is not merited; and consequently, denied where it is justly due.
AS001-0040|This explanation will serve to rectify mistakes which may already have been made, and to prevent future errors.
AS001-0041|Introduction. New readers are advised that this introduction makes the details of the plot explicit.

AS002-0039|Chapter 1. There was no possibility of taking a walk that day.  We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner
AS002-0040|(Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.
AS002-0041|I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie, the nurse,
AS002-0042|and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed. The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama
AS002-0043|in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy.  Me, she had dispensed from joining the group; saying,
AS002-0044|"She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest
AS002-0045|to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner—something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were
AS002-0046|she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, and happy, little children." "What does Bessie say I have done?" I asked. "Jane, I don’t like cavaliers or
AS002-0047|questioners; besides, there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner.  Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent."
AS002-0048|A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there.  It contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care that it should be one stored with pictures.
AS002-0049|I mounted into the window-seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double retirement.
AS002-0050|Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the drear November day.
AS002-0051|At intervals, while turning over the leaves in my book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon. Afar, it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud;
AS002-0052|near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat shrub,
AS002-0053|with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast. I returned to my book—Bewick’s History of British Birds:
AS002-0054|the letterpress thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite as a blank.
AS002-0055|They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of "the solitary rocks and promontories" by them only inhabited; of the coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity,
AS002-0056|the Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape— "Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls, boils round the naked, melancholy isles of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge pours
AS002-0057|in among the stormy Hebrides." Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland, Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland,
AS002-0058|Greenland, with “the vast sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,—that reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice,
AS002-0059|the accumulation of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold."
AS002-0060|Of these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children’s brains, but strangely impressive.
AS002-0061|The words in these introductory pages connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray;
AS002-0062|to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking. I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard,
AS002-0063|with its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon, girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the hour of eventide.
AS002-0064|The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms. The fiend pinning down the thief’s pack behind him, I passed over quickly: it was an object of terror.
AS002-0065|So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant crowd surrounding a gallows. Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped
AS002-0066|understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings, when she chanced to be in good humour;
AS002-0067|and when, having brought her ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and while she got up Mrs. Reed’s lace frills, and crimped her nightcap borders,
AS002-0068|fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure taken from old fairy tales and older ballads; or (as at a later period I discovered) from the pages of Pamela,
AS002-0069|and Henry, Earl of Moreland. With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way.
AS002-0070|I feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon.  The breakfast-room door opened. "Boh!  Madam Mope!" cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he found the room apparently empty.
AS002-0071|"Where the dickens is she!" he continued. "Lizzy!  Georgy! (calling to his sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the rain—bad animal!"
AS002-0072|"It is well I drew the curtain," thought I; and I wished fervently he might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it out himself; he was not
AS002-0073|quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza just put her head in at the door, and said at once—"She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack." And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea
AS002-0074|of being dragged forth by the said Jack. "What do you want?" I asked, with awkward diffidence. "Say, 'What do you want, Master Reed?'" was the answer.  "I want you to come here;"
AS002-0075|and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.
AS002-0076|John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I,
AS002-0077|for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious

CHECK THIS THERE IS MISTAKES

AS002-0078|visage, heavy limbs and large extremities.  He gorged himself habitually at table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks.
AS002-0079|He ought now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for a month or two, "on account of his delicate health."  Mr. Miles, the master, affirmed that he would do very well
AS002-0080|if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from home; but the mother’s heart turned from an opinion so harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John’s sallowness was owing to over-application
AS002-0081|and, perhaps, to pining after home. John had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy to me.  He bullied and punished me; not
