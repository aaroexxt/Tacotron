AS001-0001|Jane Eyre, an autobiography, by Charlotte Brontë|
AS001-0002|Preface. A preface to the first edition of "Jane Eyre"
AS001-0003|being unnecessary, I gave none:
AS001-0004|this second edition demands a few words both of acknowledgment and miscellaneous remark.
AS001-0005|My thanks are due in three quarters. To the public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain tale with few pretensions. To the press,
AS001-0006|for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened to an obscure aspirant.
AS001-0007|To my publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their practical sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and unrecommended author.
AS001-0008|The Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me,
AS001-0009|and I must thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: so are certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only large-hearted
AS001-0010|and high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling stranger; to them, that is. To my Publishers and the select Reviewers, I say cordially, gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.
AS001-0011|Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and approved me, I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know, but not, therefore, to be overlooked.
AS001-0012|I mean the timorous or carping few who doubt the tendency
AS001-0013|of such books as "Jane Eyre:" in whose eyes whatever is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest against bigotry—that parent of crime—an insult to piety, that regent of God on earth.
AS001-0014|I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions; I would remind them of certain simple truths.
AS001-0015|Conventionality is not morality. Self-righteousness is not religion. To attack the first is not to assail the last. To pluck the mask from the face of the Pharisee,
AS001-0016|is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of Thorns. These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct as is vice from virtue.
AS001-0017|Men too often confound them: they should not be confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few,
AS001-0018|should not be substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ. There is—I repeat it—a difference;
AS001-0019|The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has been accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make external show pass for sterling worth
AS001-0020|to let white-washed walls vouch for clean shrines. It may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose
AS001-0021|to rase the gilding, and show base metal under it—to penetrate the sepulchre, and reveal charnel relics: but hate as it will, it is indebted to him.
AS001-0022|Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good concerning him, but evil; probably he liked the sycophant son of Chenaannah better;
AS001-0023|yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he but stopped his ears to flattery, and opened them to faithful counsel.
AS001-0024|There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle delicate ears:
AS001-0025|who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones of society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings of Judah and Israel;
AS001-0026|and who speaks truth as deep, with a power as prophet-like and as vital—a mien as dauntless and as daring.
AS001-0027|Is the satirist of “Vanity Fair” admired in high places? I cannot tell; but I think if some of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire of his sarcasm,
AS001-0028|and over whom he flashes the levin-brand of his denunciation, were to take his warnings in time—they or their seed might yet escape a fatal Rimoth-Gilead.
AS001-0029|Why have I alluded to this man? I have alluded to him, reader, because I think I see in him an intellect profounder
AS001-0030|and more unique than his contemporaries have yet recognised; because I regard him as the first social regenerator of the day—as the very master of that working corps who would restore to
AS001-0031|rectitude the warped system of things; because I think no commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that suits him,
AS001-0032|the terms which rightly characterise his talent. They say he is like Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic powers.
AS001-0033|He resembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on carrion, but Thackeray never does.
AS001-0034|His wit is bright, his humour attractive, but both bear the same relation to his serious genius that the mere lambent sheer-lightning playing under the edge of the summer-cloud
AS001-0035|does to the electric death-spark hid in its womb. Finally, I have alluded to Mr. Thackeray, because to him—if he will accept the tribute of a total stranger
AS001-0036|I have dedicated this second edition of "Jane Eyre."
AS001-0037|Note to the third edition. I avail myself of the opportunity which a third edition of "Jane Eyre" affords me, of again addressing a word to the public,
AS001-0038|to explain that my claim to the title of novelist rests on this one work alone. If, therefore, the authorship of other works of fiction has been attributed to me,
AS001-0039|an honour is awarded where it is not merited; and consequently, denied where it is justly due.
AS001-0040|This explanation will serve to rectify mistakes which may already have been made, and to prevent future errors.
AS001-0041|Introduction. New readers are advised that this introduction makes the details of the plot explicit.
AS001-0042|At Gateshead: a nine-year-old orphan on a bitter day curls up with a book in a window-bay; is discovered and struck; fights back and is locked in terrifying ‘red-room’ by her aunt.
AS001-0043|At Lowood: the little rebel, despatched to a starvation diet in the charge of a hypocritical minister, is proclaimed a liar and makes one friend, Helen Burns,
AS001-0044|who dies in the arms of tuberculosis. At Thornfield: grown up, a governess, ‘poor, obscure, plain and little’,
AS001-0045|asserts her equality with the patrician Rochester, loves and is loved by him, only to be confounded by the existence of a lunatic wife in the attic.
AS001-0046|At Moor House: the rebel, reduced to beggary, finds kin, a fortune and strength to resist a peremptory call to missionary labour in a deadly marriage.
AS001-0047|At Ferndean: the rebel returns to a Rochester blinded and mutilated, and ‘Reader, I married him.’
AS001-0048|This was the five-part adventure of Jane Eyre that dazzled the reading public in October 1847, and, in the words of Annie Thackeray Ritchie,
AS001-0049|daughter of the celebrated novelist, William Makepeace Thackeray, ‘set all London talking, reading, speculating’.
AS001-0050|Annie Ritchie, then a child, confessed that she and her sisters ‘had taken it without leave,
AS001-0051|read bits here and read bits there, been carried away by an undreamed-of and hitherto unimagined whirlwind’. George Smith, Charlotte Brontë’s young publisher,
AS001-0052|remembered beginning the manuscript one Sunday morning: ‘The story quickly took me captive. Before twelve o’clock my horse came to the door but I could not put the book down.’
AS001-0053|Refusing all engagements, he continued reading over a sandwich lunch. Bolting his evening meal, ‘before I went to bed that night I had finished reading the manuscript’.
AS001-0054|The critic Frederick Harrison recalled in 1895 ‘the thrill which went through us all in the forties upon the appearance of Jane Eyre, on the discovery of a new genius and a new style’.
AS001-0055|What was the secret of Jane Eyre’s magical success and what inspired the backlash against the novel as a dangerous and sexually arousing feminist manifesto,
AS001-0056|a burning testament of impermissible rage which breathed the revolutionary fire of Chartism and the European revolutions of the late 1840s?
AS001-0057|Jane Eyre spoke with too personal a voice to be ignored. Thackeray summed up the book’s ability to enter the reader’s inner space and touch the heart, when he asked, after Charlotte Brontë’s early death,
AS001-0058|‘Which of her readers has not been her friend?’ This tender intimacy and forthright authenticity of address, in combination with the initial publication of Jane Eyre as ‘An Autobiography’,
AS001-0059|edited by the unknown ‘Currer Bell’, made the novel’s friends feel that they had met and would like to know more of a private person, while its enemies, appalled by its fierce unwomanly tone and incendiary message,
AS001-0060|message, repudiated its emotional nakedness, its power to seduce. The voice of Jane Eyre spoke of erotic passion, lower-caste aspiration and female rage,
AS001-0061|in a period when political radicalism was threatening the boundaries of stable order. Public curiosity was avid to break the author’s incognito.
AS001-0062|The Brontë sisters had adopted male-sounding pseudonyms because they were aware of the prevalent double standard of literary criticism,
AS001-0063|which meant that a woman writer could not hope for just evaluation. But the puzzle only inflamed the public desire to unmask the private self that had originated Jane Eyre.
AS001-0064|Was Currer Bell a man or a woman? Or both? Was Currer Bell also Acton and Ellis Bell (Anne and Emily Brontë, whose Agnes Grey and Wuthering Heights would follow Jane Eyre into
AS001-0065|print in December of the same year)? The influential novelist and critic, George Henry Lewes,
AS001-0066|intuited that the novel ‘from the depths of a struggling, suffering, much-enduring spirit’, was a woman’s composition. He too yielded to its personal appeal:
AS001-0067|‘you admire her, you love her, – love her for the strong will, honest mind, loving heart, and peculiar but fascinating person’.
AS001-0068|His recognition that Jane Eyre was characterized by ‘Reality – deep, significant reality’ touched Charlotte Brontë to the quick.
AS001-0069|Lewes later offended the author, when her identity became known and she was lionized by the London literary elite, by jesting,
AS001-0070|jesting, ‘There ought to be a bond of sympathy between us, Miss Brontë; for we have both written naughty books’. The cultured aristocrat Lady Herschel advised against leaving the book around for one’s daughters to read,
AS001-0071|and the conservative reviewer, Elizabeth Rigby, in a review that was to become notorious, hazarded the guess that, if the novel had not been composed by a man (as seemed indicated by Jane Eyre’s ignorance of cookery and dress),
AS001-0072|it must be the work of a sexual delinquent. On the question of the author’s gender, the intellectual and novelist Harriet Martineau, innocent of humour, affirmed ‘that a certain passage in Jane Eyre’
AS001-0073|about sewing on brass rings ‘could have been written only by a woman or an upholsterer’. Others considered that the power of the style ruled out female authorship.
AS001-0074|The author was no novice. Born in 1816 at Thornton and brought up in Haworth, Yorkshire, Charlotte Brontë, motherless from an early age, had been, since the premature deaths of her elder sisters, Maria and
AS001-0075|Elizabeth, the eldest sibling of a tight family of four budding young authors, who created an epic literature for their fantasy worlds of Angria and Gondal.
AS001-0076|Their father Patrick Brontë, Perpetual Curate of the church of St Michael and All Angels at Haworth, was poorly paid and the family lived in shabby and hardworking gentility.
AS001-0077|As a teacher and governess, Charlotte, mortified by her shy awareness of her stunted growth, poor skin and irregular features, was treated as if she had ‘no existence’,
AS001-0078|for a governess, as she bitterly reported, ‘is not considered as a living and rational being’.
AS001-0079|She grasped the chance in 1842 to secure an education in Brussels at the Pensionnat Heger. There, her love for her ‘master’, Constantin Heger, anguished as it was,
AS001-0080|spurred her to learn from him the principles of composition and the discipline of editing, and, after her return to Haworth in 1844,
AS001-0081|discovering the manuscript of her sister Emily’s poetry, she galvanized her sisters into publication of their poems in 1846. In 1847,
AS001-0082|they sent round the manuscripts of Emily’s novel Wuthering Heights and of Anne’s Agnes Grey, along with Charlotte’s The Professor, the latter being rejected. Undaunted, Charlotte
AS001-0083|began a new novel and, on the 24th of August 1847, sent the manuscript to the publisher, George Smith. Within months, the recluse was a sensational celebrity.
AS001-0084|The Politics of Jane Eyre. Jane Eyre is a narrative of power and conflict, composed in a period of seismic political and social turbulence, written in a manufacturing wool-town in the industrial north of England.
AS001-0085|The anxiety expressed by the conservative press about the novel’s demands for personal freedom, its assertion of famished hunger, not only physical, but also intellectual and emotional,
AS001-0086|and its disputatious protagonist’s serial defiance of authority, was a response by an elite under threat: ‘the tone of mind which has overthrown authority and violated every code human and divine abroad,
AS001-0087|and fostered Chartism and rebellion at home, is the same which has also written Jane Eyre’. In Britain during the 1840s the Chartist movement expressed,
AS001-0088|in mass demonstrations, riots, strikes and monster petitions, the rage of the working man under the economic misery caused by industrialization and capitalism. The masses,
AS001-0089|pauperized by mechanized production, united in rage to denounce inequality, demanded universal male suffrage and insisted upon equal rights.
AS001-0090|The Europe of 1847 was moving inexorably towards the revolutions of 1848. Jane Eyre was written while these events were building and it was read as they crested in what the ruling classes saw as an orgy of violence threatening to ‘civilization’ itself.
AS001-0091|What, however, did a tale of the private vicissitudes and travails of an orphaned girl, her schooling and governessing, her upright refusal of a sexual liaison with her employer
AS001-0092|and her eventual happy and legitimate marriage, have to do with Chartism? In April of 1848, after the European revolutions had spread to Italy, France, Germany and the Austrian Empire,
AS001-0093|and in the month of the ‘great’ Chartist petition in London, the Christian Remembrancer rebuked Jane Eyre as burning with ‘moral Jacobinism’:
AS001-0094|‘Never was there a better hater. “Unjust, unjust,” is the burden of every reflection upon the … powers that be.’ In December, when the revolutions had raged and failed,
AS001-0095|the Quarterly Review denounced Jane Eyre as a fundamentally unchristian book. The novel’s ‘murmuring against the comforts of the rich and the privations of the poor’ involves
AS001-0096|‘a proud and perpetual assertion of the rights of man, for which we find no authority either in God’s word or in God’s providence’. In 1855, Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine,
AS001-0097|nearly eight years after Jane Eyre’s publication, linked the European revolutions and Jane Eyre as expressions of the forces of social anarchy:
AS001-0098|‘a mere vulgar boiling-over of the political cauldron, which tosses your French monarch into chaos, and makes a new one in his stead.
AS001-0099|Here is your true revolution. France is but one of the Western Powers; woman is the half of the world.’ Jane Eyre was read as a feminist manifesto,
AS001-0100|at a time when married women had no existence in law and (under Common Law) no property or divorce rights; women could neither vote nor enter the universities or the professions.
AS001-0101|The Blackwood’s article reproved Jane Eyre as a rabble-rousing document, which had whipped up a generation of women writers to ‘grossness’ and violence.
AS001-0102|Female emancipation conjured spectres of sexual permissiveness and the masculinization of women, threatening the patriarchal family and state. Women such as George Sand,
AS001-0103|the cigar-smoking, trousered novelist and femme scandaleuse, had stood as candidates for election in revolutionary Paris. Women had fought alongside men on the barricades of Paris and Vienna.
AS001-0104|Such anathematizations of Jane Eyre were reactions to the passionate self-assertion at its heart: ‘I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am,
AS001-0105|am, the more I will respect myself’ (Chapter 27). Jane’s mutiny against her masters catches up the rhetoric of poverty and disease in an industrialized world,
AS001-0106|where people starve and are treated like the machines they serve, rather than honoured as human beings. She demands to know, ‘Do you think I am an automaton? – a machine without feelings? – and can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips …?’
AS001-0107|(Chapter 23). She claims to be her employer’s ‘equal’ and he cannot deny it. Jane’s vow to ‘keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man’
AS001-0108|(Chapter 23), is founded on and secondary to her sense of sovereign self-worth. Individual human rights therefore lie at the centre of the ethic of Jane Eyre and the conservative reviewers
AS001-0109|reviewers (themselves often women in an anomalous position as the female thought-police of a patriarchal ideology) were not wrong to see them there.
AS001-0110|The love between Jane and Rochester was read as politicized: ‘this furious love-making was but a wild declaration of the “Rights of Man” in a new aspect
AS001-0111|“Let him take me captive, seize upon me, overpower me … let us fight it out”’. Jane’s eroticized defiance of her ‘master’ is interpreted according to the discourse of economic
AS001-0112|laissez-faire as licence to engage in a sexual free-for-all. The author of Jane Eyre was a Tory and an Anglican;
AS001-0113|she was emphatically neither a Chartist sympathizer nor a revolutionary. But Charlotte Brontë was prone to use strong and extreme language, and, though she opposed the radicalism of her friends, Martha and Mary Taylor,
AS001-0115|she had internalized its language. Her politics are double-bound, a mingling of reactionary conservatism with radical individualism, for, as a working woman,
AS001-0116|she was forced to earn a living in a world that exploited single working women as cheap labour. Marriage, as the Saturday Review stated, was ‘woman’s profession; and to this life her training
AS001-0117|that of dependence – is modelled’; an unmarried woman has ‘failed in business’: governesses are ill-paid ‘because the wares they sell are worthless’. Jane Eyre speaks out furiously against the humiliation
AS001-0118|pauperized middle-class women by the elite: the Ingrams, a rich, landed family who abuse governesses in Jane’s hearing, are worthless people
AS001-0119|mercenary, mindless and base. The novel refuses deference and insists on the value and dignity of honest labour. It demonstrates that servants and dependants,
AS001-0120|quiet and still as they may outwardly be, watch, judge and curse their ‘betters’ in the sanctum of luxurious homes. This is what terrifies Mrs. Reed,
AS001-0121|who is branded by Jane’s livid childhood curse. Child abuse in ‘charitable’ institutions is also exposed by Jane Eyre. It lifts the lid on a sick,
AS001-0122|deranged and hypocritical society. Jane’s economic progress is a parable of self-help, within a competitive marketplace where,
AS001-0123|as an orphan dependant and governess, she belongs neither to the servants nor to the employing class. Conditions of employment are a subject of discussion between Jane and her employer,
AS001-0124|who ‘seems to forget that he pays me thirty pounds per annum for receiving his orders’ (Chapter 14). The ‘cash-nexus’ which the social prophet, Thomas
AS001-0125|saw as dehumanizing the relationship between employer and employee in the modern world and degrading both parties,21 is a focal issue of discussion in Jane Eyre. When the nineteen-year-old
AS001-0126|informs her ‘master’ that nobody ‘free-born would submit to’ insolent treatment from an employer, he replies, ‘Humbug! Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary’
AS001-0127|(Chapter 14). Economic relations are radically questioned. The trajectory of the plot is, ultimately, conservative,
AS001-0128|for Jane is a ‘lady’ and finds kin in the gentry world and ‘independence’ in inherited wealth. The novel’s incendiary rhetoric helps us to understand why its politics
AS001-0129|seemed to Charlotte Brontë’s own generation so violently subversive. Like the Chartists, who spoke of themselves as ‘white slaves’ and vowed to smash their chains and break out of their prison,
AS001-0130|prison, the child Jane, who (again like the Chartists) is prodigiously well read and has drawn her own deductions from her reading, retaliates against John Reed in terms drawn from the slave-revolts of Ancient Rome
AS001-0131|and of the modern world, ‘Wicked and cruel boy! … You are … like a slave-driver – you are like Roman emperors!’ (Chapter 1). Chapter II begins: ‘I resisted all the way
AS001-0132|like any other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my desperation, to go all lengths.’ A dialogue between submission and rebellion,
AS001-0133|imprisonment and liberation, the struggle for justice and the duty to endure, is initiated in the violent early chapters and is only quietened with the novel’s closure. The novel talks back.
AS001-0134|‘How dare I, Mrs. Reed? How dare I? Because it is the truth,’ the outraged child bellows. Jane Eyre speaks of slavery and revolt; its moving emotion is rage, and its temper is hot.
AS001-0135|Images of heat and fire preponderate and Thornfield Hall and its owner are punished by arson. Implicit imagery of fire
AS001-0136|(Jane is ‘ardent’, which derives from the Latin for ‘burning’) kindles the prose throughout. All the places at which she alights – Gateshead, Lowood, Thornfield, and Moor House – constitute a kind of Bastille,
AS001-0137|from which she must run, ride or (from Thornfield) crawl away on hands and knees. Modern critics, coming to the novel from a twenty-first-century perspective,
AS001-0138|query Jane Eyre’s sexual and racial politics. Jane is no longer seen as Everywoman the subversive outsider, but as ultimately endorsing ‘us’ the insular English middle class.
AS001-0139|Post-colonial critics emphasize that Jane’s inheritance is the plunder of the slave trade; that Bertha Rochester as a West Indian ‘Creole’, whether white or of mixed race, is demonized by a racist ideology,
AS001-0140|and that the fiction concludes in a cosily exclusive marriage with the land-owning gentry. An ‘unquestioned ideology of imperialist axiomatics’ is held to inform the
AS001-0141|fearless treatment of Bertha Rochester. In such readings, the treatment of Rochester’s first wife
AS001-0142|as an amoral maniac of degenerate race intimates a queasy racism which pollutes the ethic of the novel and of Jane’s marriage. Charlotte Brontë confessed that she had shown too little concern
AS001-0143|concern for the person and predicament of Bertha but she never confronted the problems of race in Jane Eyre.
AS001-0144|Such a focus upon the supposed ‘centre’ of the novel should not blind us to the powerful way it tackles, for instance, institutionalized child abuse:
AS001-0145|in Jane Eyre, a searing subjectivism acquaints readers with the hidden horrors of corporal punishment and the systematic starvation and exposure to cold and disease of helpless children in
AS001-0146|‘philanthropic’, ‘Christian’ establishments. Charlotte Brontë saw the novel as lifting the lid on an England built on violence to the young and helpless.
AS001-0147|Jane Eyre speaks out more shockingly than Charles Dickens in his exposure of the barbarities of the post-Poor Law workhouses in Oliver Twist (1838),
AS001-0148|bourgeois reader of Jane Eyre enters into the suffering child’s experience through the intimate first-person voice,
AS001-0149|which dissolves the reader’s ‘I’ into the child’s ‘I’. Harrowingly confined in Jane’s mind – seeing the flogging of Helen’s bare neck – through Jane’s quivering sensibilities,
AS001-0150|readers are imaginatively exposed to the Lowood school starvation regime and required to consider this in terms of Christ’s admonition that
AS001-0151|‘inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me
AS001-0152|Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire’ (Matthew 25:40–41, Authorized Version). Beating and brutality were endemic in schools,
AS001-0153|from elite public schools to the meanest institutions. The childish rebellion of the ‘revolted slave’ gives way to the adult’s outbursts against the injustice of patriarchy.
AS001-0154|Jane’s protest is, in a crucial passage, made explicitly feminist and placed in a nation where millions of people are silenced: It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity:
AS001-0155|they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot find it. Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and millions are in silent revolt against their lot.
AS001-0156|Nobody knows how many rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life which people earth. Women … feel just as men feel;
AS001-0157|they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts as much as their brothers do. (Chapter 12) This is familiar radical language: the double invocation of
AS001-0158|‘millions’ of people and the ‘masses’ draws on the radicals’ reminder to the ruling classes that the elite is small, massively outnumbered by the oppressed. Chartists
AS001-0159|referred to the working class as ‘the millions’, a term calculated to provoke fear. Jane’s manner is explicitly threatening and prophetic:
AS001-0160|the suppressed ‘must’ have action; they ‘will’ take it. The statement that ‘women feel just as men feel’ denies a central distinction upon which the Victorian state and family
AS001-0161|(and hence the patriarchal order) was constructed. The novel’s prevailing symbolism is of arson, riot, ferment, revolt, volcanic eruption, lunacy and explosion:
AS001-0162|in such a context, the feminist manifesto quoted above, however limited its aims appear to us now (women’s education and entry into the professions), could hardly seem anything but incendiary
AS001-0163|Jane Eyre was immediately recognized as a northerner’s book. The author lived at the hub of industrial radicalism, near the Chartist centres of Keighley, Dewsbury, Leeds,
AS001-0164|Huddersfield, Todmorden. Charlotte Brontë had seen mass starvation and unemployment. When Jane wanders, homeless and starving, on the moorlands around Whitcross,
AS001-0165|she is mistaken for a vagrant and perhaps a thief or prostitute: although the novel is set in an earlier period, chiefly in the 1820s,
AS001-0166|this figure may have conjured for readers one of the many female beggars on the run from the draconian 1834 New Poor Law, unemployment or the catastrophes endured by women in a world of dependence on men.
AS001-0167|Jane and the self. 
AS001-0168|The heroine’s name represents less a statement of identity than a question of identity. While the tightly conceived and executed plot bounds ahead with powerful momentum, the name ‘Jane Eyre’, constantly raised and queried like a wistful dream, echoes back into lost origins.
AS001-0169|Jane has no memory of her parents nor a clear conception of where she belongs, if anywhere. Her name is often invoked by the first-person narrator in the second or third person.
AS001-0170|She admonishes herself: ‘Listen then, Jane Eyre’, and the name becomes associated with self-division, loss of face, so that there seem to be two of Jane, one rational, the other passionate.
AS001-0171|‘And yet where was the Jane Eyre of yesterday?’ Jane puzzles, having failed to become a ‘Jane Rochester’: ‘where was her life? – what were her prospects? Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman
AS001-0172|almost a bride – was a cold, solitary girl again’ (Chapter 26). Eerily, the person, ‘I’, and the name, ‘Jane Eyre’, seem to part company.
AS001-0173|Her return to Mr. Rochester, having divulged her name to her kin, is also a reunion with self: ‘I am Jane Eyre … I am come back to you’ (Chapter 37). Names are talismanic.
AS001-0174|Jane was Emily Brontë’s middle name. An Eyre family owned North Lees Hall in Outseats near Hathersage, whose first mistress, Agnes Ashurst,
AS001-0175|had been confined as a ‘madwoman’ in a padded room on the second floor and suffered death by burning. North Lees, visited by Charlotte Brontë in 1845,
AS001-0176|has a claim to be considered the original of Thornfield Hall.
AS001-0177|Such associations root this displaced heroine in a sense of locality and history. But the surname is rich in other associations, all of which the novel sets subtly
AS001-0178|echoing whenever Jane’s name is raised. This canny web of allusion has an uncanny effect
AS001-0179|on the reading experience and holds in suspense an emotionally charged cluster of suggestions. Eyre suggests ‘heir’, ‘air’, ‘e’er’, ‘err’, ‘Eire’,
AS001-0180|and rhymes with ‘where?’; it plays upon the word ‘ire’, chiming in turn with ‘fire’ and ‘eyrie’. In a novel of many wanderings, it is possible for Jane to ‘err’ from her way.
AS001-0181|As an ‘heir’, what is her inheritance? Whose heir is she? The spirit’s realm is ‘air’ (hence the sublime pattern of bird imagery) but to soar into air is to die;
AS001-0182|we cannot live on air. The famished Jane will have to beg bread. Eyre chimes with ‘where’, ‘elsewhere’, ‘wherever’, ‘anywhere’, everywhere’. Outside Lowood just before Helen’s death,
AS001-0183|Jane ponders the wretchedness of being summoned from the world ‘and to have to go – who knows where?’ (Chapter 9). She questions the dying Helen, ‘Where are you going to, Helen?
AS001-0184|Can you see? Do you know?’ but is sceptical of the Christian heaven: ‘Where is that region? Does it exist?’ In the novel’s climax, she hears her name called: ‘Jane! Jane! Jane!’ and, asking
AS001-0185|‘What is it?’, she realizes that she might as well have asked ‘Where is it?’, and goes on to ask the unseen voice, ‘Where are you?’ The intensity of the novel’s search for identity
AS001-0186|is reinforced by a recurrent use of a succinct number of key words and phrases, and their synonyms. These key words encompass the elementary and elemental human plight.
AS001-0187|They have to do with our need for food, warmth, fire, home and shelter. But these synonyms are also paradoxical, for they also include antithetical needs:
AS001-0188|for freedom, interest, rights, and passion. Recurrent motifs include ‘return … home’, ‘wander’ (‘rove’, ‘err’, ‘stray’, ‘leave’),
AS001-0189|‘resting’ (‘settled’, ‘bourne’); ‘separation’ (‘cloven’, ‘split’, ‘sundered’, ‘torn away’). ‘Home’ carries a sense of the heavenly home after death;
AS001-0190|‘wanderer’ can mean a gentle ramble or being lost; a ‘resting place’ may be a grave; a ‘bourne’, so much longed for, may be an earthly home or that ‘bourne from which no traveller returns’ as in Hamlet;
AS001-0191|a ‘master’ may be a tyrant or a lover. 'My master': Power, Sexuality and Marriage. The most complex and contradictory aspect of Jane Eyre
AS001-0192|is in its treatment of gender relations and marriage. Jane calls Rochester, with keen relish, her ‘master’. But she scornfully repudiates the mastery of Brocklehurst,
AS001-0193|John Reed and St. John Rivers. Radical feminist assertion of female autonomy alternates with a craving to melt into and become one with the beloved ‘master’.
AS001-0194|In the Bible, Christ is known to his disciples as ‘Master’: the word combines love and veneration.
AS001-0195|Rochester is on the literal level Jane’s ‘master’ as a member of the landed gentry and her employer. But Jane’s use of the word is sexually charged:
AS001-0196|it counts almost as an endearment and a sign of the sexual attraction the Byronic and masterful Rochester has for Jane. Between this usage
AS001-0197|lies Charlotte Brontë’s passion for her schoolmaster, Constantin Heger, ‘Mon chèr maître’,
AS001-0198|‘the only master I have ever had’, as she wrote in painfully revealing letters. Even in the final chapters, Jane’s lover is no less her ‘master’ when she returns
AS001-0199|as Rochester’s independent equal, than when she left his employment. Yet the novel queries and renders problematic the whole idea of ‘mastery’. Rochester’s
AS001-0200|‘despotic’ behaviour to Jane before the abortive wedding is not to her taste. She asserts equality and, indeed, superiority (‘I am better than you – let me go!’).
AS001-0201|Reciprocally, Rochester, however patriarchal his assumptions, acknowledges not only that Jane is ‘my equal … and my likeness’ (Chapter 23) but his own inferiority,
AS001-0202|which he recognizes when he tells her: ‘I was your equal at eighteen – quite your equal’ (Chapter 14). He in turn appropriates the word ‘master’
AS001-0203|in relation to her: ‘you please me and you master me’ (Chapter 23) and the plot works to geld him of his excess power so that, when she returns to Ferndean, he is contrite, nearly as eyeless as Samson,
AS001-0204|requiring, like Samson, to be led, with one arm mutilated. This dynamic contrariety gives the work its nearly unflagging impetus
AS001-0205|and central character for her energy and interest: ‘I know no medium’, Jane reports in her relations with Sin John:
AS001-0206|‘I never in my life have known any medium in my dealings with positive, hard characters … between absolute submission and determined revolt’ (Chapter 34).
AS001-0207|Egalitarian marriage, in which the woman’s very smallness becomes a prop to the otherwise too dominant male, is Jane Eyre’s ideal. The happy marriage which has proved problematic for modern readers, was also,
AS001-0208|in terms of Victorian politics and ecclesiastical law, anomalous. Human rather than divine love is sacred in Jane Eyre.
AS001-0209|Charlotte Brontë manages to subvert the Scriptures by stealing their thunder, using Bible language to prefer natural impulse over heavenly aspiration; the marriage-bed over the pew.
AS001-0210|Tender and faithful eros is a higher power than missionary zeal; Eve masters Adam. The joyous repartee of the lovers enlivens their harmony: to Rochester’s querulous ‘Am I hideous, Jane?’
AS001-0211|Jane replies, ‘Very, sir; you always were, you know’ (Chapter 36). The Liberal thinker, John Stuart Mill, was to write in On the Subjection of Women (1873)
AS001-0212|that under English law the wife is her husband’s ‘bond-servant … no less so, as far as obligation goes, than slaves’. In a narrative so sensitive to the perils and temptations of ‘enslavement’,
AS001-0213|Jane Eyre yet reveres marriage as a sacrament: so sacred indeed as to displace the ‘Marriage with the Lamb’ represented by St. John Rivers.
AS001-0214|(In the biblical book of Revelation, this mysterious marriage represents the Christian’s union with Christ in the afterlife.) Rivers, as the ‘bride of Christ’,
AS001-0215|offers Jane a marriage as invalid as Rochester’s first proposal, for Rivers is, in the deepest possible sense, betrothed already. The conjugal relations he proposes would involve
AS001-0216|the institutionalized rape the law permitted: ‘Can I … endure all the forms of love (which I doubt not he would scrupulously observe)?’
AS001-0217|(Chapter 34). Men’s violence against women is treated by Charlotte Brontë with an unashamed openness unique in the period:
AS001-0218|St John implicitly proposes and Rochester contemplates rape: ‘If I tear, if I rend the slight prison, my outrage will only let the captive loose …’ (Chapter 27).
AS001-0219|The two men have more in common than either would care to concede. This parallel explains the novel’s double and apocalyptic ending. It is not Jane’s bridal but St. John Rivers’s that concludes the novel.
AS001-0220|Dying, Rivers will enter into Mystic Marriage with the Lamb, while Jane chooses the living way of the human heart. The union of man and woman in ‘one flesh’,
AS001-0221|according to the Book of Common Prayer, signifies ‘the mystical union that is between Christ and his Church … as Christ did love his spouse and the Church, who gave himself for it,
AS001-0222|loving and cherishing it even as his own flesh’. Jane Eyre thus treads a path of ambivalent Christian heresy and transgressive traditionalism: it prefers the symbol
AS001-0223|(human marriage) over the thing symbolized (union with Christ). Literary sources. Jane Eyre is a book of books, a nest of narratives:
AS001-0224|we look over Charlotte Brontë’s characters’ shoulders as they read and interpret books and hear them tell one another stories. Jane, cross-legged on the window-seat, ponders the pages of Bewick’s History of English Birds;
AS001-0225|Bessie beguiles her with tales gleaned from ballads, folk stories and popular novels; Helen Burns peruses Dr Johnson’s Rasselas and Jane is enthralled by Sir Walter Scott’s Marmion.
AS001-0226|Not only do the characters reprise their life-stories (Jane’s is told cyclically, over and over), but they obsessively ‘read’ one another’s faces and interpret them like complex and enigmatic books,
AS001-0227|according to the phrenological principles then current in the Victorian study of the psyche. Rochester discovers
AS001-0228|cryptic, double-bound uniqueness of Jane’s character, for ‘when I examined your face, one trait contradicted another’ (Chapter 19).
AS001-0229|To focus this reading of faces, Jane Eyre draws heavily on the language of nineteenth-century psychology: the sciences of phrenology, physiology,
AS001-0230|mesmerism, and the theory of chemical attraction and repulsion set out in the handbook of Romantic science (possessed by the Brontës), Sir Humphrey Davy’s Elements of Chemistry
AS001-0231|(1827). Jane Eyre takes its style and subject from a rich miscellany of sources. The plot recalls folk-tales: Bluebeard’s Castle, Cinderella, The Ugly
AS001-0232|Duckling, Beauty and the Beast. The nursery world of Fairy persists enchantingly long after Jane’s childhood is over.
AS001-0233|‘No wonder,’ says Rochester, ‘you have rather the look of another world … When you came upon me last night, I thought unaccountably of fairy tales’ (Chapter 13). Ancient traditions of dream, oral tales and legend
AS001-0234|had intrigued the Romantic poets and novelists. Jane Eyre owes a debt to Sir Walter Scott’s supernaturally suggestive Scottish landscapes as well as to Gothic fiction,
AS001-0235|which has cast thrilling shadows on the wall of the Brontë childhood. The child author of the Angrian tales had revelled in the horror stories in Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine:
AS001-0236|translations of E. T. A. Hoffmann’s ghoulish and intricate tales, James Hogg’s stories of deadly doubles,
AS001-0237|the Romantic fad for vampires and demonic possession. In Jane Eyre, Charlotte Brontë uses Gothic motifs, most obviously the madwoman ‘haunting’ the attic,
AS001-0238|not for mere sensation, but to represent the unconscious mind under the stress of its encounter with an unknown world. All experience to a needy child is
AS001-0239|implicitly uncanny, because it is unknown: the phantasmal world rises to threaten Jane in the ‘red-room’, where the waif meets a wraith in the ‘visionary hollow’ of the mirror
AS001-0240|(Chapter 2). She has lived too near to the dead and to the coldness of the living. The uncanny in Jane Eyre is mysterious and meaningful: it cannot be psychoanalysed away.
AS001-0241|It marks, for author and reader, the sense in which we are all children of the dead. When Jane returns to Thornfield from her visit to Gateshead and says, ‘I have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead,’
AS001-0242|Rochester exclaims, ‘A true Janian reply … She comes from the other world – from the abode of people who are dead’ (Ch. XXII). It is beautifully done: a magical conjuring of the strangeness of the world on which lovers balance,
AS001-0243|haunting each other in a wordplay which combines endearment, humour and wonder – and yet suggests another dimension, a spirit-world
AS001-0244|visible only to the aroused eye. Enchantment and fear are close cousins in Jane Eyre. What Rochester spies and
AS001-0245|covets Jane in the quick of her unique spirit hidden within the inconspicuous bodily cage. Delicate imagery of caged birds, the immortal spirit glimpsed in the sheen of the eye,
AS001-0246|charges the lovers’ wordplay with delicious suggestion and a sense of another, proximate world. Jane Eyre brings forward the unmediated mystery of existence
AS001-0247|itself. The ‘region of spirits’ lies around Jane, Helen, Rochester, Rivers. Just before Helen Burns’s death at Lowood, Jane, standing in moonlight,
AS001-0248|experiences the first shock of consciousness of mortality: my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend … heaven and hell: and for the first time it recoiled, baffled:
AS001-0249|and for the first time glancing behind, on each side, and before it, it saw all around an unfathomed gulf: … it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and plunging amid that chaos.
AS001-0250|(Chapter 4) Charlotte Brontë arrests the reader in this space at its graveside where one’s mind becomes ‘it’, defamiliarized,
AS001-0251|swinging above the unanswerable questions evoked by the novel. The ‘bridal vampire’ literature, such as Johann Wolfgang's Goethe’s The Bride of Corinth (1797),
AS001-0252|extracts cheap thrills from a reader by its bloody supernaturalism. Sir Walter Scott’s treatment both of the male lover in the saturnine, proud and Byronic Master of Ravenswood
AS001-0253|and of the unconscious female mind in The Bride of Lammermoor (1819) is close to Jane Eyre. Scott’s gentle Lucy Ashton, married against her will to a man she cannot love,
AS001-0254|acquiesces in her fate but murders her husband on the wedding night and is found ‘couched, like a hare upon its form – her head-gear dishevelled – her night-clothes torn and dabbled with blood
AS001-0255|her eyes glazed, and her features convulsed into a wild paroxysm of insanity … she gibbered … an exulting demoniac’.
AS001-0256|Bertha Rochester, her brother reports, ‘sucked the blood: she said she’d drain my heart’ (Chapter 20); when Jane views her, what she sees is hardly human:
AS001-0257|‘it grovelled, seemingly, on all fours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal’ (Chapter 26). What Scott had joined (the conscious and the subconscious Lucy Ashton),
AS001-0258|Charlotte Brontë splits into the opposing figures of Jane and Bertha. Yet it is in a mirror that Jane originally sees the face of the maniac (Chapter 25); Jane too has in the past been locked up
AS001-0259|and become insensible from a ‘fit’ (in chapter 2) and is a creature of rebellious passions. Sandra M. Gilbert and Susan Gubar, in an inspired and influential reading,
AS001-0260|viewed Bertha as Jane’s repressed alter ego. One of the most magical aspects of Jane Eyre is its voice. Fluid, personal, emotional, it
AS001-0261|it intimates personal presence and creates the illusion of a real person ‘behind’ the text, speaking directly to us. But, paradoxically,
AS001-0262|the novel’s language is richly allusive and self-consciously literary. The range of textual allusion is prodigious: Jane Eyre is one of the most densely allusive
AS001-0263|and intertextual works of the nineteenth century. In the tradition of spiritual autobiography, its shape, vocabulary and ethic owe a huge
AS001-0264|debt to the seventeenth-century Puritan conversion narrative and spiritual testament, especially John Bunyan’s The Pilgrim’s Progress (1678), which, since its publication,
AS001-0265|had been read as improving children’s literature. Hence, while the landscape of Jane Eyre is a fictional variant of Yorkshire and Derbyshire, its territory is also the radiant country of the soul.
AS001-0266|Jane’s five-fold progression through significantly named way-stages treads in the footsteps of Bunyan’s Christian on his way to the Celestial City. ‘Gateshead’ suggests the gate
AS001-0267|‘Lowood’ is allegorically the ‘low wood’ which incubates disease; ‘Thornfield’ refers to the ‘thorns’ of God’s curse on man’s crime in Genesis;
AS001-0268|‘Moor House’ or ‘Marsh End’ suggest the wilderness of Jane’s wanderings; ‘Ferndean’ is a sylvan vale which, however, has features in common with Lowood. While Jane Eyre is a radical,
AS001-0269|secular and feminist modern revision of Bunyan’s pathway of Christian obedience, it is also faithful to the emotional quality of The Pilgrim’s Progress and its violent combativeness.
AS001-0270|It shares with Bunyan the engaging, lovable character of the hero; a rhythm of extreme, alternating moods; paradoxical temptations
AS001-0271|and the beautiful ‘Puritan plain style’ – the pure and simple English adopted by seventeenth-century Puritans – with its premium on veracity and its suspicion of surfaces. It
AS001-0272|places trust where Bunyan does: in the human heart, with a duty to discover and live one’s own truth. But by investing marriage choice and individual identity with the
AS001-0273|shimmer of immortal consequence, Charlotte Brontë raises romance material to a matter of spiritual life and death. The generic hybridity of Jane Eyre
AS001-0274|reinforces its power and complexity. At the same time, Jane Eyre is indebted to English Renaissance literature. Allusions to Shakespeare’s Hamlet, Othello,
AS001-0275|King Lear and other plays weave a rich texture of drama and poetry. The structure also suggests a five-act Shakespeare play, and
AS001-0276|echoes the virtuosity of Shakespeare’s language, modulating between repartee, formal speeches and a quality of overheard soliloquy. Echoes of John Milton’s
AS001-0277|Paradise Lost (1667) are even more resonant, reinforcing Jane Eyre’s mythic quality and raising a generically trite love-story
AS001-0278|to sacramental status, which links it to the myth of the Fall in Genesis and the redemption in the Gospels, while questioning and rebuking the Bible’s and Milton’s misogyny in burdening Eve with
AS001-0279|responsibility for evil. Playing against this sonorous sacred poetry is the influence of the eighteenth-century realist novel, especially Samuel Richardson’s Pamela: or,
AS001-0280|Virtue Rewarded (1740). Pamela in its time was a wildly popular epistolary novel,
AS001-0281|in which the philanderer, ‘Mr. B’, makes attempts upon Pamela’s virtue, as disingenuous as they are ingenious. Traces of Pamela abound in Jane Eyre,
AS001-0282|not least in the supple, idiomatic banter which renders the courtship so poignantly delightful and maintains a sense of sexual arousal even when the two are most peaceful together.
AS001-0283|In both novels womanizers offer ‘sham marriage’ to heroines mocked by officious gentry house-guests, and are visited by fortune-telling gypsies;
AS001-0284|each is rewarded in happy marriage to the contrite offender. The landscapes of Jane Eyre, its weathers and seasons, are one of the glories of the novel. There is a closely observed attentiveness
AS001-0285|to the moods of the most minor scenes: in the winter lane near Thornfield, ‘the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop’ (Chapter 7).
AS001-0286|The poetry of Byron, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Thomas Moore and, especially, Keats, lies at the quick of the novel’s emotion.
AS001-0287|Chapter 23, the proposal scene in the garden, a stained Eden, is a variation on Keats’s ‘Ode to a Nightingale’ (1820),
AS001-0288|with its passionate melancholy: ‘wind … wandered away – away – to an indefinite distance – it died. The nightingale’s song was then the only voice of the hour …’
AS001-0289|This picks up the recessional ‘plaintive anthem’ of the last stanza of Keats’s ode, a music which recurs in Chapter 37,
AS001-0290|Jane’s reunion with the blind Rochester: ‘Who is it? What is it? Who speaks? Is it only a voice? … It is a dream.’ Keats’s ode's ends:
AS001-0291|Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades. Past the near meadows, over the still stream Up the hill-side; and now ’tis buried deep in the next valley-glades:
AS001-0292|Was it a vision, or a waking dream? Fled is that music: – Do I wake or sleep? But the beauty of Charlotte Brontë’s allusions to Keats lies in its tuneful interweaving
AS001-0293|with remembrance of Milton, the blind listener who sang not only of Paradise Lost and Regained but also of Samson’s blinding and of the invisible world in relation to lost love:
AS001-0294|Rochester laments, at Jane’s return, ‘Never will [leave me], says the vision? But I always woke and found it an empty mockery … Gentle, soft dream, nestling in my arms now,
AS001-0295|you will fly, too, as your sisters have all fled before you: but kiss me before you go – embrace me, Jane’ (Chapter 37). Behind this tender speech lies Milton’s Sonnet
AS001-0296|Sonnet xix, ‘On his Deceased Wife’ (1658?); ‘But, oh, as to embrace me she enclined, I waked, she fled and the day brought back my night’
AS001-0297|Charlotte Brontë, an indifferent versifier, was, therefore, a poet of fiction. She had learned from both her sisters. She follows Anne Brontë’s prosaic choice of a
AS001-0298|plain governess-heroine and the first-person female narrator of Agnes Grey. The influence of Wuthering Heights and of Emily Brontë’s poetry shows in
AS001-0299|shows in elemental language and landscape. The heath at Whitcross recalls the Heights; the characters’ intense cris de coeur echo the language of Catherine and Heathcliff.
AS001-0300|Rochester, though sneered at by the critic Leslie Stephen as ‘really a spirited sister of Shirley, and though he does his very best to be a man, and even an unusually masculine specimen of his sex’,
AS002-0001|owe something to Heathcliff. Like Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre can be read as a poem, rich in symbol, a dialogue of fire and ice, hunger and rage. Hearths with banked fires
AS002-0002|burn generously around Rochester; Jane’s combustible temperament stands against the cold stone of Mrs. Reed’s heart and eyes and the ice of St John Rivers’s zeal.
AS002-0003|Beneath the whole complex of influences and allusions lies the Authorized Version of the Bible. Charlotte Brontë had by heart swathes of Scripture. Scattered throughout the text
AS002-0004|are allusions to the parables, the beatitudes, the apocalypse. Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, David and his ‘one ewe lamb’, Samson and
AS002-0005|Delilah, Ahasuerus and Esther, thread their way through the story, so that the landscape of Jane’s mind and of early nineteenth-century northern England suggest
AS002-0006|ancient landscape of Israel. Bible English informs the tongue of Brontë English and a wicked vein of
AS002-0007|ecclesiastic satire runs throughout the novel. Both Brocklehurst and his Calvinist counterpart, St John Rivers, condemn themselves by their cruel Christianity. But the
AS002-0008|theology of Jane Eyre is heretical: the Gospel message of forgiveness and self-sacrifice is often refused in favour of rage against injustice that impels the individualist heroine to use the Bible
AS002-0009|(as did the revolutionaries Bunyan and Milton) as a kind of freedom-fighter’s charter, a place to wrestle with God for one’s own singular truth. Style and narrative.
AS002-0010|Jane Eyre employs a simple rather than complex grammar as a stylistic basis. Its sentences are often compounded of main clauses or phrases, whose short, emphatic words
AS002-0011|are linked by verbal and grammatical echo. The effect of this is spontaneous intensity and emotional naturalness. We overhear the vivid beating of the child’s heart,
AS002-0012|intimate with its vibrations and thundering pulse: ‘My heart beat thick, my head grew hot; a sound filled my ears … something seemed near me; I was oppressed, suffocated … the key turned …’ (Chapter 2).
AS002-0013|The child’s visceral intensity still informs the tongue of the woman. But this hectic style is tempered by quiet passages of calm, thoughtful writing and earthed
AS002-0014|in the deceptively casual everyday idiom of domestic realism which opens the fiction: ‘There was no possibility of taking a walk that day.’ Although Jane Eyre is not an
AS002-0015|epistolary novel, it reads like a personal communication. The manner confides, needles, cajoles, appeals to its readers. But the style, which excites, also mesmerizes.
AS002-0016|The hypnotic quality of Charlotte Brontë’s style may have its origins in her habits of composition as a trance writer, transcribing from her inner world on to the page with closed eyes.
AS002-0017|But in Jane Eyre, one eye is constantly open to gauge and manipulate the reader’s response. Jane Eyre shares its author’s supersensitive self-consciousness.
AS002-0018|An impression of authentic reality is aroused by economical description of familiar and unfamiliar objects. There is, from the first, a strong impression of a world we can see,
AS002-0019|hear, touch and taste. Architectural interiors are described with painstaking care to proportions, dimensions, furniture, window-spaces, and hearths.
AS002-0020|The ‘tart on a certain brightly painted china plate’; the burnt porridge at Lowood; Miss Temple’s seed-cake; Adèle’s shutcock,
AS002-0021|are all details which add solid reality to the novel’s world. Jane Eyre establishes a continuum of sound, conversion, chitchat, repartee, love-talk, birdsong,
AS002-0022|a stormily rustling dress, the clang of hooves on icy stone. Often action is carried solely by dialogue. Minor characters do much to reinforce this
AS002-0023|authenticity and sense of locality. The chorus of Bessie and Abbot gives way to the chat of Mrs. Fairfax at Thornfield, which again yields to the downrightness of Hannah at Moor House and finally,
AS002-0024|the bluff good sense of Mary and John at Ferndean. Homely and non-literary speech-patterns anchor the rhetorical effects and the outrageous plot. Yet the novel also presents a force-field of conflict.
AS002-0025|The plain style often suffers reversal, as if the very sentences were twisted round by their painful subject matter. Syntactic aversion, reversing the normal subject
AS002-0026|verb / object order of the English sentence, is used to dramatic effect in Jane Eyre: possibly Charlotte Brontë was influenced by German, which she had learned, as well as French, in Brussels.
AS002-0027|When Jane represents her banishment from the Reed family group, she focuses herself as an object which initiates the sentence: ‘Me, she had dispensed from joining the group’ (in Chapter 1).
AS002-0028|This inversion powerfully articulates the object-status and exclusion of the child. Coiled in that shrinking ‘Me’ is the spring of rage that will burst bounds in the first mutiny of Jane’s
AS002-0029|hitherto passive life. ‘Me’ will become the assertive ‘I’. Pent in such inversion is the trauma of loss: ‘from his presence I must go’, Jane realizes after the abortive marriage
AS002-0030|(in Chapter 26). As a story-teller Charlotte Brontë is unparalleled. Her mastery of suspense in Jane Eyre, combined with a canny practice of withholding the key to uncanny events,
AS002-0031|keeps the reader in a state of arousal and tension. This breathless sense of awaiting imminent knowledge, moment by moment, is finely suggested at the end of Chapter 20 when the author coins the phrase
AS002-0032|‘suspended revelation’. Rochester has just begun to open his mind to Jane: ‘I have myself – I'll tell you without parable – been a worldly, dissipated, restless man;
AS002-0033|and I believe I have found the instrument for my cure in–’. The text goes on, ‘He paused:’ and the narrative attention moves to the birds singing, the leaves rustling.
AS002-0034|‘I almost wondered they did not check their songs and whispers to catch the suspended revelation; but they would have had to wait so many minutes – so long was the silence protracted.’ The sentence is never completed;
AS002-0035|Rochester’s mood changes; he swerves from confessing the full truth. The whole narrative of Jane Eyre encourages breathless wonder: it holds a succession of pauses, digressions,
AS002-0036|incomplete sentences, riddles, and sets a trail of false clues, such as, for example, Blanche Ingram, who acts as a smokescreen for the rival wife.
AS002-0037|The plot must have been constructed backwards, in order to conceal the secrets which create suspense and tension. But it was also constructed in one of the most beautiful narrative shapes of all: a circle.
AS002-0038|The cycle of action fulfills itself in a series of returns, which conclude in the homing flight of Jane to Rochester in a reunion poised between laughter and tears.
AS002-0039|Chapter 1. There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner
AS002-0040|(Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.
AS002-0041|I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie, the nurse,
AS002-0042|and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed. The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama
AS002-0043|in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy. Me, she had dispensed from joining the group; saying,
AS002-0044|"She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest
AS002-0045|to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner—something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were
AS002-0046|she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, and happy, little children." "What does Bessie say I have done?" I asked. "Jane, I don’t like cavaliers or
AS002-0047|questioners; besides, there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner. Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent."
AS002-0048|A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there. It contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care that it should be one stored with pictures.
AS002-0049|I mounted into the window-seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double retirement.
AS002-0050|Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the drear November day.
AS002-0051|At intervals, while turning over the leaves in my book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon. Afar, it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud;
AS002-0052|near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat shrub,
AS002-0053|with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast. I returned to my book—Bewick’s History of British Birds:
AS002-0054|the letterpress thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite as a blank.
AS002-0055|They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of "the solitary rocks and promontories" by them only inhabited; of the coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity,
AS002-0056|the Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape— "Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls, boils round the naked, melancholy isles of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge pours
AS002-0057|in among the stormy Hebrides." Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland, Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland,
AS002-0058|Greenland, with “the vast sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,—that reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice,
AS002-0059|the accumulation of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold."
AS002-0060|Of these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children’s brains, but strangely impressive.
AS002-0061|The words in these introductory pages connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray;
AS002-0062|to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking. I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard,
AS002-0063|with its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon, girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the hour of eventide.
AS002-0064|The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms. The fiend pinning down the thief’s pack behind him, I passed over quickly: it was an object of terror.
AS002-0065|So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant crowd surrounding a gallows. Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped
AS002-0066|understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings, when she chanced to be in good humour;
AS002-0067|and when, having brought her ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and while she got up Mrs. Reed’s lace frills, and crimped her nightcap borders,
AS002-0068|fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure taken from old fairy tales and older ballads; or (as at a later period I discovered) from the pages of Pamela,
AS002-0069|and Henry, Earl of Moreland. With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way.
AS002-0070|I feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon. The breakfast-room door opened. "Boh! Madam Mope!" cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he found the room apparently empty.
AS002-0071|"Where the dickens is she!" he continued. "Lizzy! Georgy! (calling to his sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the rain—bad animal!"
AS002-0072|"It is well I drew the curtain," thought I; and I wished fervently he might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it out himself; he was not
AS002-0073|quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza just put her head in at the door, and said at once—"She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack." And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea
AS002-0074|of being dragged forth by the said Jack. "What do you want?" I asked, with awkward diffidence. "Say, 'What do you want, Master Reed?'" was the answer. "I want you to come here;"
AS002-0075|and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a gesture that I was to approach and stand before him. John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I,
AS002-0076|for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious
AS002-0077|visage, heavy limbs and large extremities. He gorged himself habitually at table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks.
AS002-0078|He ought now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for a month or two, "on account of his delicate health." Mr. Miles, the master, affirmed that he would do very well
AS002-0079|if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from home; but the mother’s heart turned from an opinion so harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John’s sallowness was owing to over-application
AS002-0080|and, perhaps, to pining after home. John had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy to me. He bullied and punished me; not
AS002-0081|two or three times in the week, nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near.
AS002-0082|There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he inspired, because I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young master by taking my part against him,
AS002-0083|and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though he did both now and then in her very presence, more frequently, however, behind her back.
AS002-0084|Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while dreading the blow,
AS002-0085|I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would presently deal it.  I wonder if he read that notion in my face; for, all at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and strongly.
AS002-0086|I tottered, and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his chair. “That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since,” said he, “and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains,
AS002-0087|and for the look you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!” Accustomed to John Reed’s abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it; my care
AS002-0088|was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the insult. “What were you doing behind the curtain?” he asked. “I was reading.” “Show the book.” I returned to the window and fetched it thence.
AS002-0089|“You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama says; you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not to live here with gentlemen’s children like us, and eat the same meals we do,
AS002-0090|and wear clothes at our mama’s expense.  Now, I’ll teach you to rummage my bookshelves: for they are mine; all the house belongs to me, or will do in a few years.  Go and stand by the door, out of the way of the mirror and the windows.”
AS002-0091|I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively started aside with a cry of alarm:
AS002-0092|not soon enough, however; the volume was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and cutting it.  The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its climax; other feelings succeeded.
AS002-0093|“Wicked and cruel boy!” I said.  “You are like a murderer—you are like a slave-driver—you are like the Roman emperors!” I had read Goldsmith’s History of Rome, and had formed my opinion of Nero, Caligula, etc.
AS002-0094|Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I never thought thus to have declared aloud. “What! what!” he cried.  “Did she say that to me?  Did you hear her, Eliza and Georgiana?
AS002-0095|Won’t I tell mama? but first—” He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had closed with a desperate thing.  I really saw in him a tyrant, a murderer.
AS002-0096|I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the time predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic sort.
AS002-0097|I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the time predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic sort.
AS002-0098|she now came upon the scene, followed by Bessie and her maid Abbot.  We were parted: I heard the words— “Dear! dear!  What a fury to fly at Master John!” “Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!”
AS002-0099|Then Mrs. Reed subjoined— “Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there.”  Four hands were immediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs.
