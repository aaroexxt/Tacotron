CREDIT
The structure of this dataset, (and most of the README text), I credit to
Keith Ito, who has done amazing work on an implementation of Tacotron (TTS).
This dataset was designed for that repository, but can be used in other applications as well.
Keith's Repository: https://github.com/keithito/tacotron

Book:
Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë. I did not write any of the text that I spoke.
Brontë, Charlotte. Jane Eyre. London: Penguin Books, 1996.

OVERVIEW

This is a speech dataset consisting of 399 short audio clips of a single speaker (me)
reading passages from Jane Eyre. A transcription is provided for each clip. Clips vary
in length from 1 to 12 seconds and have a total length of approximately 1 hour.

The audio was recorded in May 2018.
I will include the rest of Keith's readme file, since it is also relevant to this dataset:

FILE FORMAT

Metadata is provided in metadata.csv. This file consists of one record per
line, delimited by the pipe character (0x7c). The fields are:

  1. ID: this is the name of the corresponding .wav file
  2. Transcription: words spoken by the reader (UTF-8)
  3. Normalized Transcription (generated automatically): transcription with numbers, ordinals, and
     monetary units expanded into full words (UTF-8).

Each audio file is a single-channel 16-bit PCM WAV with a sample rate of
22050 Hz.

MISCELLANEOUS

The audio clips range in length from approximately 1 second to 12 seconds.
It was segmented manually in Audacity.

The text was also matched to the audio manually, and then fed through my (Aaron Becker's(
preprocessor to add the normalized text. A QA pass was done to ensure
that the text accurately matched the words spoken in the audio.

The following abbreviations appear in the text. They may be expanded as
follows:

     Abbreviation   Expansion
     --------------------------
     Mr.            Mister
     Mrs.           Misess (*)
     St.            Saint

     * there's no standard expansion of "Mrs."
